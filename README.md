# Calico: Connecting Parents and Caseworkers

Calico is a web-based, responsive messaging app for parents (birth and foster) and case managers to facilitate communication about children in out of home care.

## About Calico

Calico was built using Case Commons' agile development process, in response to the State of California's AGPQ solicitation.   

1. The Calico team was led by Nicole Reece (Product Manager).  Team members: 
	* Pierre Klein (UX) 
	* Pema Geyleg (Technical Architect)

	* Jimmy Chao (Full stack developer)
	* Oana Tararche (Full stack developer)

3. Calico was developed using Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, React, Gulp, PostgreSQL, and other cool tech.
4. Unit and feature tests were developed in Rspec, and automated using [Solano] (https://www.solanolabs.com/) for continuous integration.
5. We used the open source [nginx] (https://www.nginx.com/) web proxy, and [puma] (http://puma.io/) application server.
