# Calico: Connecting Parents and Caseworkers

Calico is a web-based, responsive messaging app designed for birth and foster parents, and case managers. It enables parents to locate nearby Foster Family Agencies (FFA), identify agency case managers and engage in dialogue with these professionals and other stakeholders.   Its chief goal is to facilitate communication about children in out-of-home care.

To get started, parents go to [http://calicoapp.co] (http://calicoapp.co) and create a profile with a California zipcode. Once logged in, users are taken to their My Messages page with a welcome message with details about how to locate FFAs and communicate with caseworkers.  Users link to FFA profiles with additional information and can then start a conversation with a caseworker.   Users can also reset passwords, update profiles, and upload profile pictures. 

Calico was developed in response to the State of California’s ADPQ solicitation.

## Calico is: 

* Intuitive, using familiar web conventions
* Mobile first and responsive — supporting any device 
* Designed to evolve to additional user roles (e.g., foster children).  

Calico reflects Case Commons’ years of experience building child welfare software with a user-centered, agile process.  We involved users early and often in user-centered evaluation, and iteratively released working code.   Our approach is consistent with both the ADPQ RFI requirements and the [US Digital Services Playbook] (https://playbook.cio.gov).

## Team Labor Categories

The Product Manager (PM), Nicole Reece  also served as Project Manager and proxy Product Owner for this project.  Nicole had full authority and responsibility to build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  Her team included:

## Agile and User-Centered Design Process

* The project started with research to understand the business need  with (proxy) business stakeholders.  The PM then conducted secondary research to understand the California context, including legal requirements, Continuum of Care Reform and the Quality Parenting Initiative.  

* The PM and Interaction Designer brainstormed/sketched , wrote story cards and held a visual style session on product values and “inspiration” products.

* The PM and UX team then interacted iteratively with users.  Initial meetings focused on product and problem definition, and potential solutions. Follow-up meetings advanced the product concept through human-centered design activities: 

  * Interviews  to identify specific needs and potential features 
  * Live wireframing sessions 
  * Usability testing with live prototypes 
  * Design peer review sessions
